# Flex Panels Gallery
This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `Flex Panels Gallery` on vanilla JS. You can use it for your own purposes.


### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/FlexGallery/

### Create a new project based on the FlexGallery
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., FlexGallery).
``` bash
git clone https://khanevich.github.io/FlexGallery/ FlexGallery
cd FlexGallery
```
